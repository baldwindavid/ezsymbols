# ezSymbols Mac Keyboard Layout

This is a Mac keyboard layout for programmers or anyone that types symbols a lot.

The layout is QWERTY with all symbols and numbers switched such that typing numbers requires shifting. A few other high-traffic symbols have traded places with less used symbols for efficiency.

- `_` and `#`
- `{` and `&`
- `}` and `*`
- `:` and `;`

## Installation

- Copy `ezsymbols.bundle` to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`
- Open `System Preferences` > `Keyboard`
- Click on `Input Sources`
- Click `+`
- Select `ezSymbols` under `English`
- You might need to login/logout for it to take
