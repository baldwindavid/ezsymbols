# ezSymbols Mac Keyboard Layout

This is a Mac keyboard layout for programmers or anyone that types symbols a lot.

The layout is QWERTY with all symbols and numbers switched such that typing numbers requires shifting. A few other high-traffic symbols have traded places with less used symbols for efficiency.

- `_` and `#`
- `{` and `&`
- `}` and `*`
- `:` and `;`

## FAQ

**Q: What if I type numbers a lot?!**
A: If you type numbers a lot more than symbols this is probably not the layout for you. But maybe you want an actual hardware ten key. You might also consider toggling between this layout and the companion [tenkey](https://github.com/baldwindavid/tenkey) layout.

**Q: What if I like the concept, but not this layout?**
A: It is quite easy to create your own Mac layout using [Ukelele](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele)
